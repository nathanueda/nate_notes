    % The backslash after LaTeX adds a space.
    Hello! This is my first \LaTeX\ document. % Adding a `\\` creates a soft return (a newline as part of the same paragraph (no indent)).
    
    % Anything between a pair of `$` is in inline math mode (instead of the default text mode).
    % Anything between `\[` and `\]` is in displayed math mode (has a separate line for the math equations).
    A rectangle has side lengths of $ (x+1) $ and $ (x+3) $. % Adding a space between this and the above line, this would indicate a hard return (adds a newline and creates a new paragraph (adds an indent)).
    The equation \[ {A(x)=x^2+4x+3} \] gives the area of the rectangle. % Surrounding the equation in curly braces ensures the whole equation is on one line.
