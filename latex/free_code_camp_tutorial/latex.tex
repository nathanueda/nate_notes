\documentclass[11pt]{article} 

\begin{document}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Define: {\verb|\documentclass[<optional args>]{<class type>}|}.
        \item Ex: \verb|\documentclass[11pt]{article}|

        \item Create a space by adding \verb|\|.
        \item Ex: \verb|Hello! This is my first \LaTeX\ document.|

        \item Create a soft return (a newline as part of the same paragraph (no indent)) by adding \verb|\\| at the end of line.
        \item Ex: \verb|Hello! This is my first \LaTeX\ document. \\|
    
        \item Create a hard return (adds a newline and creates a new paragraph (adds an indent)) by adding a space between lines.

        \item Anything between a pair of \verb|$| is in inline math mode (instead of the default text mode).
        \item Ex: \verb|A rectangle has side lengths of $(x+1)$ and $(x+3)$|

        \item Anything between \verb|\[| and \verb|\]| is in displayed math mode (has a separate line for the math equations).
        \item Ex: \verb|\[A(x)=x^2+4x+3\] gives the area of the rectangle.|

        \item Surrounding an equation in curly braces ensures the whole equation is on one line.
        \item \verb|\[ {A(x)=x^2+4x+3} \]|.
        
        \item Superscripts: Only the immediately following digit
